# Textpad Editor

*Simple and lightweight text editor*

---

#### Overview

Textpad is a simple, general-purpose and cross-platform text editor written in C++ using the Qt libraries. Textpad aims to be faster and more lightweight than most text editors, but as useful as them. Additionally, Textpad supports syntax highlighting, word count, line count and comes with various color schemes.

Unlike many other projects, Textpad's source code aims to be as simple as possible, so that both the programmer and the user benefit from it.

#### Usage

To use Textpad, you need to be able to:

+ Use a mouse and/or trackpad.
+ To read and understand a text.
+ Know how to use a keyboard.
+ Use common sense.
+ Pay attention when saving files (don't blame me for not knowing where you put your files).
+ Click the Report bug menu if you find a bug, this will help me make Textpad better and more stable.
